  If a simple product is part of a Configurable product page, should the simple product be
  rendered as a configured option of the configurable product page?

  How does this work:

  When the `products(filters: { url_key: { eq: 'simple-product' } }) { ... }` query is ran,
  Magento also returns the Simple product and the Configurable product the simple belongs to.

  If that is the case we render the configurable product page instead of the simple product page but
  the options to select the simple product are pre-selected.
