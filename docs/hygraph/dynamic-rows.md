# Hygraph Dynamic Rows

Dynamic Rows offer the ability to add rows to multiple pages using rule based
relations (instead of adding a row to each page manually). These rules are based
on common properties between those pages. An example of such property would be
the category. Let's take a deeper look.

## Example of injecting a Dynamic Row

Let's say we want to inject a Dynamic Row which displays a discount banner for
all socks with animal prints with a price lower than â‚¬7.50. We want to place it
after the product specs:

1. We name the Dynamic Row `discount-banner-row`
2. The row we want to inject. In this case the row `discount-banner`.
   ![row-to-insert](https://github.com/graphcommerce-org/graphcommerce/assets/1244416/5cada894-daef-45ef-bbb9-0ddedca0ecf5)
3. We set the placement on `AFTER`
4. The placement target will be `product-specs`
5. For the conditions we will use the `Text` and `Number` components nested in
   an `AND` component.

The result is as follows:

![dynamic-row-fields](https://github.com/graphcommerce-org/graphcommerce/assets/1244416/d3f26e9e-0ad0-4713-86a8-67f2fa2b6a97)

The Dynamic Row should now be injected on all the pages whose properties match
the conditions.

## How does it work?

The magic of the Dynamic Row functionality, is all in the `HygrahPageContent()`
function. This function takes 4 arguments.

1. The graphql client
2. The current page URL
3. Optional: The properties to match the dynamic row with. This should be an
   object.
4. Optional: Cached (standard false)

## The structure of a Dynamic Row

To inject a dynamic row, go to Hygraph and add a Dynamic Row entry. You will see
the following fields:

1. Internal name. This is the name of the Dynamic Row.
2. Row. This is the Row you want to inject. i.e. a Row Column One or a Row
   Links.
3. Placement. You can place the injection before or after the placement target.
   You can also replace the placement target.
4. Placement Target. The row you want to place the Dynamic row before, after or
   replaced.
5. Conditions. Here you will match which pages should display the dynamic row.

### Placement

Placement has a few key behaviours.

1. When placement target is empty or not found, and before is selected, the
   Dynamic Row will be placed before all other rows.
2. When placement target is empty or not found, and after or replace is
   selected, the Dynamic Row will be placed after all other rows.
3. When placement target is found, the injected row will be placed before, after
   or replace the placement target accordingly.

### Conditions

The conditions are matched against the properties of the pages you want to
inject into. As explained in 'How does it work?' we can give an object of
properties to a page. You can add a custom object to the `HygraphPageContent()`
in your own NextJS pages. You can then use the conditions field in Hygraph to
match those properties.

The conditions field works as follows:

- We can match against string or number values using the Text and Number
  components.
- Text and Number components contain a property and a value field. This way we
  can match values against the page properties. If there is a match the Dynamic
  Row will be injected.
- The property can be accessed with javascript dot notation. If the object
  contains an array of objects, you don't have to use bracket notation. Let's
  say categories is an array of category objects which hold the category name:

  ```tsx
    {
      categories [
        {
          name: "Animals",
        },
        {
          name: "Landscapes",
        },
      ]
    }
  ```

  In this case, the property field can be accessed using `categories.name`
  syntax.

- Number components contain an additional field called operator. Here we can
  match if a number is equal to, greater than or lower than.
- We can implement logic with the And & Or components. These components allow
  nesting of Text and Number components.
